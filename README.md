# SOLID Principles

**S** - Single Responsiblity principle(SRP)

**O** - Open/Closed Principle

**L** - Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)

**I** - Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)

**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)

## [SRP](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/SRP)
- One responsiblity
- when we acheive SRP, the amount of posiblity increases
- Code maintainablity
- Dependency management
- Loose coupling
- Class should have one and only reason to update, which brings it should have single responsiblity


[example1](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/SRP/example1)

## [OCP](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/OCP)
- open for extension and closed for modification

## LSP


[example1](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/LSP/example1)

## [ISP](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/ISP)
- have smallest possible interface between class/obj when they communicate
- keep your interfaces as small as posible

[example1](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/ISP/example1)

## [DIP](https://github.com/ajeeth-b/SOLID-Principles/tree/master/DIP)
- depend upon Interface/abstraction rather than concrete classes.
